    - **FOCUS ON LINES:** The output should be suitable for creating black and white line art.

**YOUR TASK:**
Generate a JSON object with a single key "pages". This key must be an array of exactly [PAGE_COUNT] strings. Each string must be a simple visual scene description for an image AI, starting with the protagonist's name.
